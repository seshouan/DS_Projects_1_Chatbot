# Chatbot
Created a simple chatbot that combines NLU (Natural Language Understanding) and NLG (Natural Language Generation) techniques to engage in a simple dialog with the user, based on a small dictionary of language patter ('intents' and 'entities')

## How To Run it

### 1. Train the chatbot language model
Execute 'python train_chatbot.py' in the active directory

### 2. Launch the chatbot gui
Execute 'python gui_chatbot.py' in the active directory

### 3. Take it for a spin
Ask the chatbot a number of questions and see how it responds. Remember though, his NLP dictionary is quite limited for now...
